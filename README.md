# Taskcluster Documentation Site


This is the Taskcluster documentation site, hosted at the `/docs` path of a Taskcluster deployment.
It's a basic static site, generated with some Gulp plugins.

Development Setup
-----------------

  1. Copy `user-config-example.yml` into `user-config.yml` and fill in the blanks. _Note: This config is only used during development!_
  2. Install: `npm install` or `yarn`
  3. [Optional] If you want remote references locally, run `npm run download` or `yarn download`.
  4. Run the webserver: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
    * Note that it does not auto-reload on change.

Deployment
----------

This site is deployed using Nginx, serving static content. Build the static
content with `gulp build-static`, or if you want to run the webserver right
away, use `gulp webserver`.

Note that we still support the "old way" as well, so much of the site is
designed around producing objects to upload to S3, and then reverse-engineered
into static files for Nginx.

Publishing (Old Way)
--------------------

This is done automatically, but for the record: `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`.

Third-Party Libraries and Tools
-------------------------------
The Taskcluster Documentation Site wouldn't have been so awesome without these
amazing libraries and tools, upon which it is built.
