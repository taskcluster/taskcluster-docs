<h1>Secrets</h1>
<p>The secrets service allows task cluster clients with appropriate scopes to
write secrets securely, and in such a way that each secret is tied to a scope.
Further, scopes are used to limit the operations a particular client may
perform on any secret they have been granted access to.
